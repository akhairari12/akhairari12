## Hi there ðŸ‘‹

- My name is Arnav Khairari and I am currently a Second Year who is majoring in Data Science and Computer Science at Rutgers University.
  
-I am currently working on an API that can handle my schedules, and emails and even look at any data I wish upon request.

-I am currently learning how to use Python to develop bots so it can help me with my workload. In my academics, I am also learning Java through Intro to Computer Science and how to use statistical methods to validate my code through Statistical Inference for Data Science. 

- I plan to take Data Structures, Data Wrangling with R, and Discrete Structures next semester.

-What I find fascinating outside of data science and computer science is building Legos, golf, and playing Pickleball with my friends. I also want to learn how to cook.

- A fun fact about me is that I used to study political science before getting involved in STEM.
